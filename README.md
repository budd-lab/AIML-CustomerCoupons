This ReadMe contains summary findings of the data analysis completed for Machine Learning whether a customer will accept a coupon.

**For Bar Coupons, my hypothesis is that frequency of bar visit is the single most important factor that drives the likelihood of accepting bar coupons. This is based on the below findings:**

1. The average bar acceptance rate is 41%. This serves as a grounding base number to compare for the rest of the analysis
2. 37% acceptance rate of bar coupons by those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month is almost half of the acceptance rate of 77% for those went more than 3 times
3. The acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 is approx. 70%, significantly higher than average acceptance rate of 41% for all others
4. The acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry is 71%, much higher than the avaerage rate of 41%
5. The acceptance rate for drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed is 71%, much higher than average rate
6. The acceptance rate for drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is 72%, much higher than average rate
7. The acceptance rate for drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K is only 41%, same as average rate

**For Coffee Coupons, my hypothesis is that the likelihood of accepting coffee coupons is strongly dependent on drivers driving at 10AM, followed by 2PM. It is also dependent on coupon expiration of 1 day and drivers driving to no urgent place. This is based on the below findings:**

1. The acceptance rate for drivers driving at 10AM is 64% and 2PM is 55%, significantly higher than overall average --> Time is a great predictor
2. The acceptance rate for coupons expiring in 1 day is 58%, significantly higher than overall average --> Expiration is a great predictor
3. The acceptance rate for drivers driving home is 36% and drivers driving to no urgent place is 58% --> Destination is a good predictor
4. The acceptance rate for drivers driving with friend(s) is 60% and with partner is 57%, significantly higher than overall average --> Passanger is a good predictor
5. The acceptance rate for drivers during rainy weather is 52% and Snowy weather is 43%, relatively similar to overall average --> Weather is not a great predictor
6. The acceptance rate for drivers during cold temperature is 44%, relatively similar to overall average --> Temperature is not a good predictor
7. The acceptance rate for male and female is very similar, relatively similar to overall average --> Gender is not a great predictor
